    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Web accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web development that ensures websites and web applications are usable by all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. It means creating digital content and designing user interfaces in a way that accommodates diverse needs and provides an inclusive online experience.</p>
<details>
    <p>Web accessibility is crucial for several reasons:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> It allows people with disabilities to access and interact with web content, making the digital world more inclusive.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Many countries have enacted accessibility laws and regulations, and non-compliance can lead to legal consequences.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> Accessibility improvements often benefit all users by making websites more user-friendly and efficient.</li>
      <li><strong>Wider Audience:</strong> By ensuring accessibility, websites can reach a broader audience, potentially increasing their reach and impact.</li>
      <li><strong>SEO Benefits:</strong> Search engines consider accessibility factors, so accessible websites may achieve better search engine rankings.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Web accessibility involves practices like providing alternative text for images, semantic HTML structure, keyboard navigation, and more. It's a continuous process that should be integrated into the web development workflow from the beginning.</p></details>

<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p><h3>User Feedback and Revisions:</h3>
  Some of my relatives said that everything fine. So i asked my friends and they sugested to add Light/Dark theme button and to play with images in it. Some random guy from my another class suggested to add video to show how CrewDragon was launched. My own big want(as i heard in class) was to add countdown to next launch.</p>
<h3>Challenges and Problem-Solving:</h3>
<p>Main challenge was Ligh/Dark mode. From writting proper CSS to JS. And i decided to target JS firstly and it worked. After realizing how everything works i become to do CSS. CountDown still isn't realized as i wanted but let it be. My first and main idea was to get some third-party to get every future launch date and to connect it somehow with timer itself. But I never figured out how to do it and made it manualy to set the date. Almost forget about What's new button with this pop-up thing. That was hell to adjust everything but I did it. </p>
<h3>Overall Growth:</h3>
<p>After all assignments this one particularly the most difficult and interesting at the same time. To watch how HTML CSS and JS work together is a pleasure for eye. Beyond the specific project, this semester has been a period of substantial growth. From coding proficiency to project management, I've developed a more comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>

Progressive enhancement is a web development approach that centers on building a website's functionality from a content-first perspective. Unlike graceful degradation, which prioritizes the most advanced browsers and addresses older ones as an afterthought, progressive enhancement focuses on delivering a solid experience to all users, regardless of their device or browser capabilities.
<details>
<p>In the progressive enhancement mindset, the content forms the foundation of the website. The development process starts by marking up the content in rich, semantic HTML. This content "peanut" is then layered with rich, creamy CSS to enhance its visual presentation. Finally, JavaScript is added as the hard candy shell, providing additional interactivity and functionality.</p>

<p>The analogy of a Peanut M&M illustrates the concept well. The layers of chocolate and candy envelop the content, much like styles and scripts wrap around the core information. This approach aligns with the web standards movement's emphasis on separationâ€”separating content, presentation, and behavior for a more maintainable and adaptable development process.</p>

<p>In the context of the layers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Peanut (Content):</strong> Some users, like those on mobile devices or older browsers, may only need or be able to access the raw content. Ensuring that the markup conveys essential details about the content is crucial for providing a basic experience to these users.</li>
<li><strong>The Chocolate Coating (CSS):</strong> This layer adds visual styling to the content. Users with limited CSS support fall into this category. By progressively enhancing styles, developers can cater to users who may not have optimal JavaScript support or may have security restrictions on its usage.</li>
<li><strong>The Hard Candy Shell (JavaScript):</strong> JavaScript is introduced to enhance interactivity and provide a richer user experience. Unobtrusive JavaScript practices are emphasized, allowing the website to adapt to the capabilities of the user's browser or device. This step ensures that users with more capable browsers can enjoy a more interactive and dynamic experience.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why Progressive Enhancement Matters:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inclusive User Experience:</strong> Progressive enhancement ensures that users with varying devices and browsers can access and interact with the content, promoting inclusivity and broad accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> By prioritizing content and layering enhancements, websites developed with progressive enhancement are more adaptable to changing technologies and user needs.</li>
<li><strong>SEO and Accessibility:</strong> Search engine spiders and users relying on assistive technologies benefit from well-structured, semantically marked-up content, contributing to improved SEO and accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proofing:</strong> The approach aligns with the ever-evolving nature of the web, allowing websites to evolve gracefully as new technologies and standards emerge.</li>
</ol>
