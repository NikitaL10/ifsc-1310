    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>

    <h3>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h3>

    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>While a Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, it cannot land on the Moon due to its limited propellant capacity. The Falcon Heavy can deliver a Dragon 2 capsule to the Moon, but it lacks the necessary delta-v to land. Additional technology development would be required for lunar landings.</p></details>

    <h3>What is Red Dragon?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martian surface. It would be an unmanned scientific lander, capable of carrying additional cargo and equipment to Mars. The project's funding and official announcements are pending.</p></details>

    <h3>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>No, the Dragon is not suitable for a manned Mars mission due to its limited space and life support capabilities. Elon Musk has stated that Dragon 2 can support seven astronauts for "several days," which is insufficient for a journey to Mars.</p></details>

    <h3>Why does the Dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>The Dragon can only berth to the ISS because it uses a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port, not a NASA Docking System (NDS) port. Berthing requires manual control and is slower than docking, which is autonomous. Docking is faster but requires a different port.</p></details>

    <h3>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>The Dragon 1 is not suitable for ISS evacuation. It berths to the ISS and lacks the speed and automation required for quick evacuations. The station always has Soyuz spacecraft ready for rapid evacuation, making Dragon unnecessary for this purpose.</p></details>

    <h3>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>No, Dragon spacecraft lack the necessary features and fuel for reboosting the ISS. The current reboosting solutions are effective and do not require Dragon's involvement.</p></details>

    <h3>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>The Dragon 2 has a delta-v of approximately 420 m/s, primarily provided by its SuperDraco engines. This capability is crucial for various mission phases, including launch escape and controlled descent.</p></details>

    <h3>What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters were to fail during landing?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Dragon 2 can lose up to two of its eight SuperDraco thrusters without issues. In case of a thruster failure during landing, the craft will deploy parachutes, ensuring a safe splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean. Parachute landings on land are not considered as the thrusters actively control the descent.</p></details>

    <h3>Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>No, SuperDraco engines are significantly more powerful than Draco engines and designed for different purposes. Draco engines are used for in-orbit maneuvers, while SuperDraco engines are used for launch escape and controlled descents. They serve different functions and cannot replace each other.</p></details>
    <h3>What is PICA-X? Does PICA-X ablate?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>PICA-X (Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator - Enhanced) is an improved heat shield material used on Dragon capsules. It does undergo ablation, allowing the material to dissipate heat during reentry while protecting the spacecraft. PICA-X versions offer better reusability and protection from extreme heat and speeds.</p></details>

    <h3>Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Technically, yes, but economically, it is not feasible. The Hubble Space Telescope lacks the necessary equipment for a Dragon 2 to service it efficiently. It would be more cost-effective to build and launch a new telescope with modern technology.</p></details>

    <h3>How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</h3>
    <details><summary>Answer</summary><p>Dragon's reentry involves a carefully orchestrated sequence, including a deorbit burn to enter the atmosphere, jettisoning the trunk, and deploying parachutes for a controlled descent to a splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean.</p></details>
